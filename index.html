<div class="firstq">
  <h2 class="animated intensifies">New Moon Phase</h2>
<p>When: From New Moon (crescent moon or dark moon) to the first quarter moon</p>

  <p> What Happens: The moon is waxing (growing bigger) in this phase, and living things apparently feel an upsurge of energy! One thing is for sure though, sap rises during this period. Delay doing anything in the patch until a tiny wee fingernail of the moon is actually visible.</p>
  
  <p>What to do in the patch: Planting, grafting and transplanting leafy annuals is recommended in this phase, as is whacking in cereal and grain crops. It’s a great time to mow the lawn, prune many plants and provide low environmental impact liquid fertiliser to the patch.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="secondq">
<h2>First Quarter Phase</h2>
<p>When: From First Quarter to Second Quarter</p>
<p>What Happens: The moon is still waxing (growing bigger) in this phase, and the sap is still flowing! Gardening is NOT recommended in the 12 hours before the full moon.</p>
<p>What to do in the patch: Still a great phase for starting things off and even better for planting, grafting and transplanting fruiting annuals (those that produce above the ground, and have their seeds inside, like tomatoes, capsicums, beans and peas). Cereals and grains can also go in now, and it’s still okay to feed if you need.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="thirdq">
<h2>Full Moon Phase</h2>
<p>When: From 12 hours after Full Moon to Third Quarter</p>
<p>What Happens: All living things, be it plants, pets or people, are at the peak of their electromagnetic energy during the full moon phase (we’ve all heard about folks getting the crazies around this time, it’s all about the energy!).</p>
<p>What to do in the patch: Sap is flowing downwards during this time, so whacking in bulbs and root crops that produce underground is perfect. Pruning and harvesting is recommended during this phase, but avoid planting most foliage and edible plants, as their initial growth will be impressive but will wane (just like the moon during this phase)</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="fourthq">
<h2>Last Quarter Phase</h2>
<p>When: From Third Quarter to New Moon (dark moon)</p>
<p>What Happens: This phase is barren which, in gardening terms, can be translated as, well, a bit boring and tedious.</p>
<p>What to do in the patch: This phase is all about doing those annoying jobs in the garden, the ones we put off all the time, like weeding, cultivating, pest control and fertilising. It’s also the best time to mow the lawn, especially if you want to slow down the growth of the grass. Preparing patches for impending planting is a perfect project during this phas</p>
